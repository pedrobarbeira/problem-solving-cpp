This program numbers the lines found in a text file. Write a program that 
reads text from a file and outputs each line to the screen and to another file 
preceded by a line number. Print the line number at the start of the line 
and right-adjusted in a field of three spaces. Follow the line number with a 
colon, then one space, then the text of the line. You should get a character 
at a time and write code to ignore leading blanks on each line. You may 
assume that the lines are short enough to fit within a line on the screen. 
Otherwise, allow default printer or screen output behavior if the line is too 
long (that is, wrap or truncate).
A somewhat harder version determines the number of spaces needed 
in the field for the line numbers by counting lines before processing 
the lines of the file. This version of the program should insert a new 
line after the last complete word that will fit within a 72-character line
