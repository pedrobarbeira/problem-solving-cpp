Hello!
This is a text junk email written by #N#.
Hopefully it'll work out OK in the first run.
For the second version, #L# took the liberty of changing it up.
Using L# instead of N after the first # makes the program write the
last name, while an # NL#, without the space, adds both names.
This way, #NL# made it possible to play around with what was going 
to happen. This is actually fun!
Goodbye!
